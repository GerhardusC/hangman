How to play:

A random word is selected at the start of the game. The length of this word is represented by underscores right above the set of letters that you can interact with.
To play, click on the letters that you think make up your word.
If you click on a letter that is contained in the word, it will appear in the display above the letters at each instance that the letter can be found.
If the letter you clicked on is not in the word, part of the hang-man will start being drawn.
The hang-man is made of 10 lines, if all the lines are drawn, you lose.
Feel free to mute the sound with the mute button.
